# Age and Gender Prediction using CNN

A deep learning project to predict **age (regression)** and **gender (binary classification)** from facial images using **PyTorch**.  
This repository includes a **CNN built from scratch** and a **fine-tuned pretrained CNN**, along with an inference pipeline to generate predictions on unseen images.
